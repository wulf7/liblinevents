liblinevents
============

Copyright (c) 2015-2016 Vladimir Kondratyev <wulf@cicgroup.ru>

The purpose of this shim library is to provide linux events API on
the *BSD family of operating systems. The library uses kqueue(2)
to monitor timers, signals and file descriptors activity.

Following APIs are suported:

- epoll
- eventfd
- timerfd
- signalfd



Requirements
------------

- clang(gcc);
- FreeBSD



Downloading
-----------

This project does not have a special home page yet. The source
code and the issue tracker are hosted on Github:

  https://github.com/wulf7/liblinevents



Building
--------

Building from a git snaphost is as simple as:

  $ make



Testing
-------

After you build the library, you can run tests to ensure that
everything works in your system:

  $ make test

At current time it does not pass all tests so can be considered
useless.



Using
-----

To use the library, all you need to do is to link your application
with it (adding -llinevents to LDFLAGS works in almost all cases).
Of course, you will need to have include (-I) and linker (-L)
directories to be properly set in your project.



Limitations
-----------

Its not possible to implement eventfd, timerfd and signalfd
entirely in userspace so this library intended to prototype porting
only. Use POSIX, libevent or kqueue for real work.

Due to presence of broker thread, there is small delay between
changing state of event and ablility to read from and write to
its file descriptor so intensive usage is extremely racy especialy
in non-blocking mode.

In most cases I recomend you to not install this library on
default include and library paths e.g. /usr/local/include and
/usr/local/lib as some 3-rd party software prefers to use
linux event API rather than POSIX or BSD kqueue.
